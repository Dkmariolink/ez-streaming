## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use type hints where helpful
- **Qt/PySide6**: Maintain consistent styling via StyleManager
- **Architecture**: Leverage existing manager classes and event bus
- **Comments**: Explain complex logic, especially UI interactions
- **Error Handling**: Use custom exceptions from exceptions.py

### Commit Messages

### Review Process

3. **User Testing**: Functionality verification with real streaming setups
4. **Merge**: To development branch first, then master for releases

## Architecture Guidelines

### Manager Pattern
EZ Streaming uses a manager-based architecture:
- **ConfigManager**: Handles all configuration persistence
- **StyleManager**: Manages UI themes and styling
- **ProcessManager**: Tracks and controls launched applications
- **ResourceMonitor**: Monitors system resources and process detection

### Event Communication
Use the UIEventBus for decoupled communication:
```python
from event_bus import UIEventBus, EventType

# Publishing events
UIEventBus.publish(EventType.STATUS_UPDATE, "Launching OBS...")

# Subscribing to events
UIEventBus.subscribe(EventType.PROCESS_LIST_CHANGED, self.update_ui)
```
### Data Models
Use structured data models from config_models.py:
```python
from config_models import ProfileConfig, ProgramConfig

# Create structured configuration
program = ProgramConfig(
    name="OBS Studio",
    path="C:/Program Files/obs-studio/bin/64bit/obs64.exe",
    use_custom_delay=True,
    custom_delay_value=3
)
```

### UI Consistency
Maintain consistent styling through StyleManager:
```python
self.setStyleSheet(self.style_manager.get_button_style("primary"))
```

## Community and Support
