# Best Practices Guide

This guide provides proven strategies and recommendations for optimizing your EZ Streaming setup.

## Profile Organization

### Create Purpose-Specific Profiles

Instead of one massive profile, create targeted setups:

**Gaming Streams**
- Game capture software (OBS, Streamlabs)
- Voice communication (Discord, TeamSpeak)
- Game-specific tools (overlays, bots)
- Performance monitoring tools

**Creative Streams**
- Creative software (Photoshop, Blender, etc.)
- Reference browsers with inspiration tabs
- Background music applications
- Screen annotation tools

**Podcast/Talk Shows**
- Recording software (Audacity, Reaper)
- Video call applications (Zoom, Discord)
- Note-taking applications
- Background music/soundboard apps

**IRL/Travel Streams**
- Mobile streaming apps
- Communication tools
- Navigation/map applications
- Emergency contact applications

### Profile Naming Conventions

Use clear, descriptive names:
- `Gaming - Competitive FPS`
- `Art - Digital Painting`
- `Podcast - Solo Recording`
- `Collab - Guest Streams`

## Launch Order Optimization

### Recommended Launch Sequence

1. **Core Infrastructure First**
   - Streaming software (OBS, Streamlabs)
   - Audio management tools
   - Network monitoring applications

2. **Communication Tools Second**
   - Discord, TeamSpeak
   - Chat management tools
   - Moderation bots

3. **Content Applications Third**
   - Games, creative software
   - Browsers with necessary tabs
   - Reference materials

4. **Enhancement Tools Last**
   - Overlays and widgets
   - Analytics tools
   - Secondary monitoring software

### Why This Order Works
- **Stability**: Critical apps start first and stabilize
- **Dependencies**: Later apps can connect to earlier ones
- **Performance**: Heavy apps launch when system is fresh
- **Recovery**: If something fails, core setup is already running

## Launch Delay Strategies

### Delay Guidelines by Application Type

**Instant Launch (0 seconds)**
- Lightweight utilities (Calculator, Notepad)
- Pre-installed Windows applications
- Simple text editors

**Short Delay (1-3 seconds)**
- Communication apps (Discord, Skype)
- Music players (Spotify, iTunes)
- Basic browsers
- Simple overlay tools

**Medium Delay (3-7 seconds)**
- Streaming software (OBS, Streamlabs)
- Content creation tools
- Games with normal launch times
- Video editing software

**Long Delay (7-15 seconds)**
- Heavy applications (Photoshop, Blender)
- Games with long startup times
- Virtual machines
- Development environments

### Dynamic Delay Strategies

**Progressive Delays**: Increase delays as you go down the list
- App 1: 0 seconds
- App 2: 3 seconds  
- App 3: 5 seconds
- App 4: 7 seconds

**Heavy App Clustering**: Group resource-intensive apps with longer delays
- Light apps: 2-3 seconds
- Heavy apps: 8-10 seconds
- Return to light apps: 2-3 seconds

## System Performance Optimization

### Pre-Launch Preparation

**Close Unnecessary Applications**
- Background applications using CPU/RAM
- Other streaming software not in use
- Heavy browser tabs from previous sessions
- Unused development tools

**System Maintenance**
- Restart computer if it's been on for days
- Check available RAM and disk space
- Ensure Windows is updated
- Update graphics drivers regularly

**Network Optimization**
- Close bandwidth-heavy applications
- Pause cloud syncing (OneDrive, Google Drive)
- Disable Windows updates during streams
- Consider QoS settings for streaming

### Resource Management

**Monitor System Resources**
- Use Task Manager to check CPU/RAM before launching
- Set process priorities for critical applications
- Consider upgrading RAM if consistently maxed out
- Monitor disk usage, especially for recording

**Application-Specific Optimization**
- Configure OBS with appropriate settings for your hardware
- Set Discord to low CPU usage mode
- Disable unnecessary browser extensions
- Use game mode in Windows for better performance

## Application Configuration Best Practices

### OBS Studio Optimization

**Pre-Configure Scenes**
- Set up all scenes before adding to EZ Streaming
- Test all sources and ensure they work
- Configure hotkeys for scene switching
- Set appropriate output settings for your hardware

**OBS Launch Settings**
- Launch with specific profile: `--profile "ProfileName"`
- Launch with specific scene collection: `--collection "CollectionName"`
- Start minimized to tray: `--minimize-to-tray`

### Discord Configuration

**Optimize for Streaming**
- Enable "Streamer Mode" to hide sensitive info
- Set appropriate input/output devices
- Configure noise suppression settings
- Set up server-specific notification settings

**Voice Settings**
- Test microphone levels before streaming
- Configure push-to-talk if preferred
- Set up voice activity detection thresholds
- Enable noise suppression and echo cancellation

### Browser Optimization

**Pre-Load Important Tabs**
- Bookmark frequently used streaming resources
- Use browser profiles for different stream types
- Enable tab syncing for consistency
- Consider using browser automation for repetitive tasks

**Extension Management**
- Only install necessary extensions
- Disable resource-heavy extensions during streams
- Use ad blockers to reduce page load times
- Configure privacy settings appropriately

## Advanced Workflow Strategies

### Multi-Monitor Setups

**Application Placement Strategy**
- Streaming software on secondary monitor
- Game/content on primary monitor
- Chat and monitoring on tertiary monitor
- Use window management tools for consistency

**Profile Variations for Different Setups**
- Home setup (multiple monitors)
- Travel setup (single laptop screen)
- Guest setup (unfamiliar equipment)
- Emergency setup (minimal applications)

### Backup and Recovery

**Configuration Backups**
- Regularly export/backup your EZ Streaming config
- Save application settings separately
- Document your setup for quick recreation
- Keep a "minimal" profile for emergencies

**Redundancy Planning**
- Have backup streaming software configured
- Keep alternative communication methods ready
- Test your setup regularly to catch issues early
- Have contact information for technical support

### Collaboration Workflows

**Guest Stream Preparation**
- Create specific profiles for different types of guests
- Pre-configure communication applications
- Test screen sharing and audio routing
- Have backup communication methods ready

**Team Stream Coordination**
- Standardize application versions across team
- Share profile configurations when possible
- Coordinate launch timing with team members
- Establish communication protocols for issues

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

**Weekly**
- Check for application updates
- Clear temporary files and caches
- Test critical application launches
- Review and adjust launch delays if needed

**Monthly**
- Backup EZ Streaming configuration
- Review and optimize profiles
- Check system performance and resources
- Update graphics drivers and Windows

**Before Important Streams**
- Test full launch sequence
- Verify all applications work correctly
- Check network stability and speed
- Ensure all necessary accounts are logged in

### Update Management

**Application Updates**
- Update applications during off-stream times
- Test applications after updates
- Keep note of version numbers that work well
- Have rollback plan for problematic updates

**EZ Streaming Updates**
- Read release notes before updating
- Backup configuration before major updates
- Test new features in development environment first
- Report bugs and provide feedback to developers

## Community and Sharing

- Remove personal information from profiles
- Document any special setup requirements
- Include application version information
- Provide clear instructions for adaptation

**Profile Documentation**
- Explain the purpose of each application
- Note any special configuration requirements
- Include recommended delay settings
- Share performance considerations

### Getting Community Help

**When Asking for Help**

- Include your hardware specifications
- Share relevant profile configuration
- Be specific about what's not working

**Contributing Back**
- Share successful configurations
- Help others with similar setups
